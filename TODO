Load zipcodes for locations data set.

Go through pooled_crimes.csv file. For every crime, look up its zipcode. Mark down zipcode and date of crime.

zipcodes <- read.csv('zipcodes.csv', header = TRUE, sep = '\t')
crimes <- read.csv('pooled_crimes.csv', header = TRUE, sep = '\t')

for (crime in crimes)
{
	zip <- with(subset(zipcodes, Location == crime$location), Zipcode)
	print(paste(crime$date, zip, sep = '\t'))
}
